\subsubsection{Disease Control}

In China, Markov models have been used to predict the spread of \gls{pwd} in the Anhui Province for 2030 \parencite{liu2022occurrence}.
The model was able to make predictions with an overall accuracy of 93.19\%.
While this demonstrates that Markov models can be used to predict diseases, its us
In food forests, this could be aplied; however the Markov model used, modelled an area of area of $4.17 \times 10^6\:\text{ha}$, while food forests in the Netherlands are usually only between $0.5\:\text{ha}$ and $0.25\:\text{ha}$ \parencite{roodhof2024understanding}.
